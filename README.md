Original idea: https://github.com/nosesisaid/fumo-api

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is WIP (Work In Progress), it will be convert to a RPC to use Discord API middleware to validate our keys, so that will be a time factor

> [!NOTE]
> The Discord App enchanced by Gateway (a http bot), could be removed to test locally and the rest API will work fine

the docs are generated by Swagger and OpenAPI Standard, look into https://fumos.onrender.com/docs to more info about endpoints

characters can be found at `src/data/characters.json` :)

> [!NOTE]
> Although we use MongoDB clusters to store our database, you are highly recommended to use it locally create one local with MeowDB or QuickDB instead of Mongoose. Btw, we use redis to make it faster and storage a local cache
